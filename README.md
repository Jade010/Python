# Python Repository
Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository contains various projects I've worked on for data analysis and application development. I love creating applications that have utility, I often create apps that I can use for everyday purposes or creative projects. I also use Python regularly as a data analyst for cleaning, transforming, visualizing, and automating data to identify patterns and get insights from data. I love performing analysis through Python Jupyter Notebooks and add various comments so others can follow along in steps and replicate my process.
