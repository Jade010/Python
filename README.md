# Python Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository contains various projects I've worked on for data analysis and application development. I love creating applications that have utility, I often create apps that I can use for everyday purposes or creative projects. I also use Python regularly as a data analyst for importing, cleaning, transforming, visualizing, and analyzing data to identify patterns and get insights from data. I love performing analysis through Python Jupyter Notebooks and add various comments so others can follow along in steps and replicate my process. I'm constantly evolving and improving so projects are always being improved and changed over time. 

## Projects Under Construction
I'm currently working on a e-commerce data analysis project! **2024**
