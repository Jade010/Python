# Python Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository contains various projects I've worked on for data analysis. Each project in this portfolio represents my ability to import, clean, transform, visualize, and analyze data to identify patterns and insights. I love performing analysis through Python Jupyter Notebooks and add various comments so others can follow along in steps.
