# Name Generator

## Overview
The Name Generator is a Python-based tool designed to creatively generate random names, suitable for a variety of applications like fiction writing, game character creation, or any scenario where imaginative naming is required. I personally use this to create faux datasets for projects. This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming, algorithm design, and data handling.

## Key Features
- Ability to generate first names, last names, or full names based on user selection.
- Users can specify the number of names to be generated.
- Easy to use prompts guide the user through the name generation process.

## How to Use
1. Start the Program: This project requires Python. Run NameGenerator.py in a Python environment.
2. Choose the Name Type: Select from first names, last names, or full names.
3. Receive Names: Generated names are displayed instantly.

## Technical Highlights
1. The program efficiently reads and processes names from text files using list comprehensions. This approach ensures that names are handled in a memory efficient manner while capitalizing them for consistent formatting.
2. The application leverages the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI), making it user-friendly and accessible. This demonstrates proficiency in integrating Python with GUI frameworks.
3. Incorporates interactive elements such as radio buttons, dropdown menus, and text input fields to capture user preferences. This showcases the ability to create dynamic and responsive UI elements.
