# Name Generator App

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script, NameGenerator.py, that utilizes the tkinter library to create a GUI application for generating random names. It can generate first names, last names, or both, based on the input files first-names.txt and last-names.txt. I really enjoy using randomized names for faux data, game characters, and creative writing so I developed this application to make the process easier. 

## Key Features
- Ability to generate first names, last names, or full names based on user selection.
- Users can specify the number of names to be generated.
- Easy to use prompts guide the user through the name generation process.
- The program reads and processes names from text files and capitalizes them for consistent formatting.
- The application uses the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI), making it user-friendly and accessible.
- Incorporates interactive elements such as radio buttons, dropdown menus, and text input fields to capture user preferences.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This script requires the tkinter module, which is included in standard Python installations.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the files into your local machine.
2. Ensure that the files first-names.txt and last-names.txt are in the same directory as the script. These files should contain a list of first names and last names respectively, one per line.

## Running the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing NameGenerator.py.
3. Run the script by entering the following command:

       python NameGenerator.py
