# Name Generator App

## Overview
The Name Generator is a fun and simple Python application designed to generate random names for a variety of purposes. I enjoy using randomized names for faux data, game characters, and creative writing so I developed this application to make the process easier. 

## Key Features
- Ability to generate first names, last names, or full names based on user selection.
- Users can specify the number of names to be generated.
- Easy to use prompts guide the user through the name generation process.
- The program reads and processes names from text files and capitalizes them for consistent formatting.
- The application uses the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI), making it user-friendly and accessible.
- Incorporates interactive elements such as radio buttons, dropdown menus, and text input fields to capture user preferences.

## How to Use
2. Start the Program: This project requires Python. Run NameGenerator.py in a Python environment.
3. Choose the Name Type: Select from first names, last names, or full names.
4. Receive Names: Generated names are displayed instantly.
